#About

These are my personal files I use to run and use a second keyboard as a macro device. This repository is not a guide on how to set this up, however, I might possibly do this depending on if it gets requested.

To give some brief info on what the files and applications do:
    Registry.txt = This simply keeps a registry of what macros I have, what they do, and what keys they are bound to.
    printSheets = These files are for printing stickers to place ontop of the keycaps.
    HIDMacros = This app allows the better management of second keyboards on windows. For more info: http://www.hidmacros.eu/whatisit.php
    AutoHotKey (AHK) = This can be used to write more complex scripts for macros. For example, I use it for keeping an application window ontop of another application window               without it automaticaly minimising the window that is not in use qhwn clicking on the other window.
    LuaMacros = This is the main app that runs the scripts used to create the macros.
    Program = This folder contains a script that initiates all of the other scrips so It can be used automatically on startup. To use this, you would need to create a start up         event in event viewer that runs it.
    
If you would like to know more, please google "Second keyboard macro". There will be many usefull guides on how to set this up yourself. Taron from LinusTechTips has a usefull repository too: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard
